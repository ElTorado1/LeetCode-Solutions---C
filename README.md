# AI & Machine Learning Roadmap (Custom for Your Requirements)

---

## 1. **Foundations**
- **Learn Basic Python** (if not yet familiar)
  - Data structures, loops, functions, OOP basics
  - Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

---

## 2. **Core Machine Learning Concepts**
- **Supervised Learning**
  - **Sınıflandırma (Classification):**
    - Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Trees
    - Practice with sklearn
  - **Regresyon (Regression):**
    - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression
    - Practice with sklearn
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

---

## 3. **Model Validation Techniques**
- **Leave-One-Out Cross Validation**
  - Understand how it works and where to apply
- **Cross Validation (k-Fold)**
  - Implement using sklearn
  - Know when to use which method

---

## 4. **Deep Learning Frameworks**
- **Keras**
  - Build simple neural networks
  - Practice MNIST digit classification
- **TensorFlow**
  - Learn about tensors, computational graphs
  - Implement DNNs, basic image models
- **PyTorch**
  - Understand tensors, autograd, modules
  - Re-implement previous models in PyTorch

---

## 5. **Computer Vision Basics**
- **OpenCV**
  - Image I/O, resizing, transformations
  - Basic image processing operations (blurring, edge detection, etc.)

---

## 6. **Deep Learning for Computer Vision**
- **CNN’ler (Convolutional Neural Networks)**
  - Learn CNN architecture (Conv, Pool, Flatten, Dense)
  - Implement image classification models in Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- **Segmentasyon (Segmentation)**
  - U-Net, FCN models
  - Practice semantic segmentation tasks

---

## 7. **Project & Practice**
- Work on small projects:
  - Image classification (cats vs dogs, digits, etc.)
  - Image segmentation (semantic or instance)
- Try Kaggle datasets for hands-on practice

---

## 8. **Suggested Learning Order (with checkpoints)**
1. Python basics, numpy/pandas/matplotlib
2. Classification and Regression with sklearn
3. Model validation techniques (leave-one-out, cross validation)
4. Keras (basic models, then CNNs)
5. TensorFlow and PyTorch (re-implement models, compare differences)
6. OpenCV for image handling
7. CNNs in Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch (focus on image classification)
8. Segmentation models (study architectures like U-Net)
9. Build and validate your own models

---

## 9. **Resources**
- Courses: Coursera (Andrew Ng ML + Deep Learning Specialization), Fast.ai, YouTube (Aladdin Persson, Sentdex)
- Documentation: [Keras](https://keras.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- Practice: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

---

### **Tip:**  
Work with each framework (Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV) as you progress—don’t try to master all at once; focus on concepts, then compare implementations.

---

**Good luck! Start small, keep building, and don’t hesitate to revisit concepts.**
